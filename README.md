# Panorama3D - Visualization Tests for Panorama  
3D scrolly story tests for Panorama at Queens Museum. I am using SketchFab API to test camera moves and object manipulations. The structure of the layout comes from [this example](https://labs.sketchfab.com/experiments/article-scroll/). The iframe sources a model of Higgins hall from my SketchFab account.
